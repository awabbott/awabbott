<h1>Hello! My name is Andrew.</h1>
<p>Since April 2020 I have been studying web development. My goal is to provide immense value to companies that have dedicated themselves to helping others in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>My current project is buiding a personal website that is functional, attractive and responsive using purely HTML and CSS. Meanwhile, I am starting to learn JavaScript while getting involved in and contributing to the software development community.</p>
<h2>The Road to Here</h2>
<p>I graduated from Arizona State University with a B.A. in Anthropology, a B.A. in Russian, and spent several years at a major financial institution, but always held a desire to get into the military, a three letter agency or law enforcement - a career that would let me help others in a major and meaningful way.</p>
<p>I married the girl of my dreams, and a few years later, we had a son. The primary focus, now, has shifted to providing the best life possible for the three of us. I decided the ideal career should include the following (in this order):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A good, flexible lifestyle</li>
    <li>A desire for me to become a subject matter expert</li>
    <li>The ability to meaningfully help others</li>
    <li>Good income</li>
    <li>Be challenging, difficult and somewhat prestigious</li>
  </ol>
<p>It quickly became apparent that a career web development could be an excellent fit.</p>
<h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
<p>I've set a goal to get hired as a front-end software developer by April 2021.</p>
<p>According to others who have shared their journey, going from <em>brand new</em> to <em>valuable enough to get paid</em> within one year is ambitious but doable. The pathway I've constructed changes frequently, but developing a deep understanding vanilla JavaScript and applying it to solve real world problems, however minor they may be initially, is the next step.</p>
<h2>Contact Me</h2>
<p>If you have any input, comments, suggestions or criticism, I'd be happy to hear from you.</p>
