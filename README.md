#Hello! My name is Andrew.
Since April 2020 I have been studying software development. My goal is to work as a full-stack software developer by August 2022.

I'm currently working on recreating the game, Battleship. It uses ASP.NET Core MVC and connects to an API to persist the data. I vanilla Javascript for the UI.

My previous project is buiding a personal website that is functional, attractive and responsive using purely HTML and CSS. Meanwhile, I am starting to learn JavaScript while getting involved in and contributing to the software development community.
##The Road to Here
I graduated from Arizona State University with a B.A. in Anthropology, a B.A. in Russian, and spent several years at a major financial institution, but always held a desire to do something more technical and challenging. I decided the ideal career should include the following:
 - A good, flexible lifestyle
 - A desire for me to become a subject matter expert
 - The ability to meaningfully help others
 - Good income
 - Be challenging, difficult and somewhat prestigious
It quickly became apparent that a career web development could be an excellent fit.
##The Road Ahead
I've set a goal to get hired as a front-end software developer by April 2021.
According to others who have shared their journey, going from <em>brand new</em> to <em>valuable enough to get paid</em> within one year is ambitious but doable. The pathway I've constructed changes frequently, but developing a deep understanding vanilla JavaScript and applying it to solve real world problems, however minor they may be initially, is the next step.
##Contact Me
If you have any input, comments, suggestions or criticism, I'd be happy to hear from you.
