### Hello! My name is Andrew.
___
<!-- Check out [my portfolio](http://www.yourazhousebuyer.com). -->

Since April 2020 I have been studying software development. My goal is to work as a full-stack software developer by August 2022.

I'm currently recreating the game, Battleship. The project uses ASP.NET Core MVC and connects to an API to persist the data. I use vanilla JavaScript for the UI.

My last fiew projects have included:
- Buiding a simple CRM. User management is handled through ASP.NET Core Identity. Users can sign in through Google or through two factor authentication, and once logged in, they can add/update/delete new customers along with mutiple addresses per customer. Data is sent from the web application to a separate API that communicates with SQL Server through EF Core.
- A console application that pulls real estate data from public sites and imports to a SQL database for analysis.
- Building a personal website that is functional, attractive and responsive using purely HTML and CSS.

I'm currently learning more about C# along with the basics of JavaScript while getting involved in and contributing to the software development community.

#### The Road to Here
After graduating from college I spent several years at a major financial institution, and later ran my own real estate business, but I always held a desire to do something more technical and challenging. Fast forward a few years, and I became a stay at home dad. I took this time to clarify my interests, and it quickly became apparent that a career in software development could be an excellent fit.

#### The Road Ahead
I've set a goal to get hired as a full-stack software developer by August 2022.
According to others who have shared their journey, going from *brand new* to *valuable enough to get paid* without a science degree or bootcamp is challenging but doable. I'll continue building applications, solving problems (however minor they may be) and sharing what I learn along the way.

If you have any input, comments, suggestions or criticism, I'd be happy to hear from you. The best way to reach me is by email at <andrew.abbott2@gmail.com>.
